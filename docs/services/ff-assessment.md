## FAIR Assessment

### Use in the context of the FAIRification Framework
This service will assess the FAIRness of a Digital Object within the Climate Adaptation community. The metrics used will be defined by the efforts of the Climate Adaptation community (in the context of the FAIR2ADAPT case studies) and by FAIRness experts involved in the project.

A version of the tool will be used to validate the FDO created in the final stage of the FAIRification Framework pipeline.

### Input / Outputs

The service will accept the url/pid of a Digital Object, and will produce a JSON file with the results of the assessment, based on the specification defined [here](https://fairos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/output/)
