## JackDAw AI LLM model integrating GI services

### Role in the FAIRification Framework
This service implements an AI-driven interface and metadata engine to support FAIR data access and integration, enabling users to easily discover, select, and connect to relevant data sources through natural language.

The service plays a central role in the FAIRification Framework by enabling automated metadata generation, semantic enrichment, and standardized access to data sources. They bridge the gap between raw or legacy data and FAIR principles, supporting data discovery, interoperability, and reuse across systems.

### Input / Outputs

Input: well described ontologies of relevant data sources.

Output: the output will be a human-language interface powered by the JackDAw AI LLM model for intelligent data source selection, and a metadata engine enabling FAIR-compliant access and integration of diverse data sources.
