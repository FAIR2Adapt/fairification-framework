The objective of the framework is to support the FAIRification of data and services that are part of the FAIR2Adapt system architecture by providing the means to automatically assess, homogenise and enrich FDO metadata.

Although the primary focus is on testing it within the FAIR2ADAPT project, we have incorporated design considerations to ensure it can be applied to other projects as well.

In this documentation, you can see the architecture of the framework, including all the resources and services that are involved in the process.
